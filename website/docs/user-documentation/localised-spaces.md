# Work only with points in the map
By default, Decidim Geo takes all the points, even they are not geolocated. This enable participants to discover broader participation, for example processes that effect all the spaces. 

In some cases, you will like to use Decidim Geo to strictly uses points on the map. Hopefully, we have an option for that in the administration.
