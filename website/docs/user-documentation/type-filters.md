# Type filter

This filter allows you to filter resources by types. By default, Decidim Geo supports: 

- Meetings
- Proposals
- Accountability Results
- Debates
- Assemblies
- Processes

**Disabled filter**<br />
If no points of a type is available, the filter will be greyed out and disabled. This will avoid users to get no results when they filter. 

**Customize Space pages**<br />
If you customized the Assemblies or Processes page, the type filter will disapear as [described in the documentation](./customize-space-pages)
