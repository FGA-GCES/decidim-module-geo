# Hide points from map

**Use case**<br />
When you use proposals to gather data from citizen, you will have many points that are not necessarly related to participation. 
When this is the case, you want to restrict the displaying of these points to only the space where they are. 
For exemple, if you have a proposals in "Data Gathering Ideas", these proposals would be displayed only in the context of this Assembly, and won't see it in any other places, like the home page. 

## Configure 

In component configuration of the geo-friendly components, you can hide geolocated points outside this space (assembly/process).
