**My assembly is private, can I see points in Decidim-Geo?**<br />
For now, we support only points that are visible publically. So if your assembly is private and transparent, the points will be displayed. 
Else it won't have any maps. 

**I have installed Decidim Geo, but I can not see maps in my process**<br />
Decidim Geo will hide empty maps, so if no points are available in your space, maps won't be displayed. 

**I have some accountability results from a process last year, will it be displayed in active filter?**<br />
Yes, they will be active as soon as they don't have a end_date.
