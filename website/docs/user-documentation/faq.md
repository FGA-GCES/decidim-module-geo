**My assembly is private. Can I see points in Decidim Geo?**  
Currently, Decidim Geo only supports points that are publicly visible. If your assembly is private but transparent, the points will display. Otherwise, no maps will be shown.

**I installed Decidim Geo, but I can't see maps in my process.**  
Decidim Geo hides empty maps. If no points are available in your space, maps will not be displayed.

**I have accountability results from a process last year. Will they show up in the active filter?**  
Yes, they will appear as long as they do not have an end date.
