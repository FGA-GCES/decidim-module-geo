# Customize Space pages (Assemblies, Processes)
To have a broader perspective when you access to the main assemblies or processes pages, you can configure Decidim Geo to display on spaces on the map.

- Display only assemblies in Assemblies: on the assemblies main page, display in Decidim Geo only the assemblies
- Display only processes in Processes: on the processes main page, display in Decidim Geo only the processes

To define this option, check the options in the Decidim Geo configuration page from the admin dashboard.

**When active, the _type_ filter won't appear in Decidim Geo**<br />
If you activate this option, the filter for type won't show up, as these maps will display only the assembly or process type.
