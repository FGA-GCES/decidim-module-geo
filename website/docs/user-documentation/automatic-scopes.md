# Automatic Scopes

A recurring task can automatically assign points to a region. This removes an extra step for participants while ensuring accurate mapping of information.

## What It Does

An automatic check will bind a resource to a shape based on the following conditions:

- If the space (assembly, process) does not have scope enabled
- If the component does not have any scope enabled
- Then, all meetings, debates, accountability results, and proposals with geolocation will be mapped automatically to a scope.

### Use Case: Participatory Budget

In a proposal phase for participatory budgeting, you can enable geolocated proposals. When participants submit proposals, they can map an address. After publication, an external process will verify if the point falls within one of your scopes and will assign it accordingly.
