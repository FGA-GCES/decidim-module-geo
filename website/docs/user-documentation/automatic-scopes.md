# Automatic Scopes
A recurrent task can assign auto-magically points to a region. This allows you to ask one thing less for the participant, and still map correctly the information.

## What it does?

Following the following rules, an automatic check will bind a resource to a shape. 

- If the space (assembly, process) does not have scope enabled
- If the component does not have any scope enabled
- Then: All meetings, debates, accountability results, proposals that have a geolocation will be mapped automatically to a scope.


### Use case: Participatory Budget

On a proposal phase for a participatory budget, you can active geolocated proposals. 
Once participant propose, they will be able to map an address. 
After a while beeing published, an external process will check if this point is inside one of your scopes, and will assign it.
