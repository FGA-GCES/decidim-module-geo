# View Filter

In Decidim Geo, there are two types of points:

- **Points on the map:** These are elements that can be pinned to a specific location on the map.
- **Points not on the map:** These represent more general elements (like global processes) that are not tied to an exact location.

The view filter lets participants quickly focus on items either on the map or those not mapped.

**Working only with points on the map**  
If Decidim Geo is configured to [work exclusively with points on the map](./localised-spaces), this filter will be disabled and hidden from the platform.
