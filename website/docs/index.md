# Decidim Geo

This project starts from a simple idea: if we display all a decidim platform participation on a map, participants will find easier how to participate locally. For platform that tries to enable small, local participation that would be essentials, and from a systemic perspective, this will allow us to zoom-in and zoom-out in a simple way to test and valorize participatory experiments. Here the [first presentation (french)](/decidim-geo-presentation-0.pdf) we did for the city of Lausanne, that kicks the project in!

## Decidim Geo enable participants to discover participation in a map.
