Even with massive participation, Decidim Geo handles it smoothly.  
We've also added compatibility with some awesome modules: `accountability` and `report-proposals`.  
Check out the features we've got!

**Performance**<br />
Queries are now cached and paginated, significantly speeding up map display times!

---

**Reporting Proposal Compatibility**<br />
You can now seamlessly add the (Decidim Reporting Proposal module)[https://github.com/openpoke/decidim-module-reporting-proposals].

---

**Mobile Adaptation**<br />
Participants can now use their phones to engage. Combined with Reporting Proposal, these adaptations offer a great mobile-first experience.

---

**Accountability on the Map**<br />
Accountabilities can now be displayed on the map, allowing participants to see ongoing work on the platform.

---

**Hide Points for a Component**<br />
Any meeting, proposal, or other component can now choose to hide their points from being indexed in other spaces.  
This makes it easier to use Reporting Proposal by, for example, preventing reports from appearing on the map.
